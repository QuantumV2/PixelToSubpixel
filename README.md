# PixelToSubpixel

## Converts 1 bit pixelart to images that look the same on LCD subpixels, can be seen in more detail with a digital camera ...or squinting

## Use:

1. Install requirements.txt:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Add your target file to the root folder (or use an existing one)
3. Run the script:
    `py generate.py filename.png`
4. Open in any program that can display at a resolution of 1:1 pixel ratio (I use Chrome)
5. Have fun!
